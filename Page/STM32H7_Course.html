<h1>THE UNIVERSE OF THEOREREVERSE</h1>
<div class="container">

    <!-- EPISODE 01 -->
    <button class="accordion">Episode 1 — The Infinite Forest of Dimensions</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            Aria stepped into the <b>Infinite Forest of Dimensions</b>, where every tree trunk was a doorway into another universe. The leaves shimmered with quantum light, bending probability itself with every gentle sway.
        </p>
        <p>
            A glowing compass floated beside her — a relic from the ancient Time Architects.  
            It pointed not north, but toward <b>the timeline where she was needed most</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suddenly, one tree flickered violently — a universe collapsing. Aria sprinted toward it.  
            Someone inside was rewriting the laws of reality.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- EPISODE 02 -->
    <button class="accordion">Episode 2 — Architect of Broken Timelines</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            Aria entered the dying universe. Time fractured around her like shattered glass.  
            There, she met him — the <b>Chrono–Engineer</b>, a scientist who could manipulate the temporal fabric using pure logic.
        </p>
        <p>
            “This world was unstable long before I arrived,” he said calmly.  
            “I’m trying to fix what the Architects abandoned.”
        </p>
        <p>
            But Aria sensed something darker behind his words —  
            <i>someone</i> was hunting him. And soon, they would be hunting her too.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- EPISODE 03 -->
    <button class="accordion">Episode 3 — The Fracture Core Awakens</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            Deep beneath the broken universe lay the <b>Fracture Core</b>, a pulsating construct of pure timeline energy.  
            It responded to thoughts, memories, and fears.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Aria touched its surface, visions struck her—
            worlds vanishing, timelines erased, civilizations forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
            She pulled her hand away, but the Core had recognized her.  
            “The chosen observer,” it whispered through her mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            And awakening it had consequences — consequences now rippling across every universe.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- EPISODE 04 -->
    <button class="accordion">Episode 4 — Quantum Echoes of Tomorrow</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>
            Aria and the Chrono–Engineer traveled through a temporal vortex to find answers.  
            Instead, they found <b>echoes of themselves</b> — quantum reflections from possible futures.
        </p>
        <p>
            One echo warned her:
            <br><i>“Do not trust the Engineer. His future self destroys the Architects.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            But another echo contradicted it:
            <br><i>“He is the key to restoring the multiverse.”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            With paradoxes closing in, Aria faced her first impossible choice —  
            which version of reality should she believe?
        </p>
